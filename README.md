# StepMania-Launcher
A simple launcher for StepMania written in Python.
# How to use
Create a new folder called .sm in your Documents folder. In that folder, create a folder named "versions-vanilla". There, copy all your vanilla (not modified) versions of StepMania. Here's what it should look like as an example:
```
Documents\
  .sm\
    versions-vanilla\
      3.95\
        Program\
```
This has only been tested on Windows so far.
# How to use modified versions
Create a new folder in your .sm folder starting with "versions-" and then the name of the modded version/fork you're using. For example, "versions-openitg". Then, it pretty much works the same as vanilla versions except that they are prefixed with the versions folder name in the launcher itself.
# How to use downloads
In 0.3.0 and later, there is a downloads manager. You need to make a downloads.list file, with this exact syntax (example):
```
[Name]:[URL]:[Type:noteskin]:[Version:3.95]
```
Yes, you need the square brackets or it won't work.
Either you can make your own downloads.list, or you can download the one from this repo. The choice is yours.

And that's about it!
